# Sentiment Analysis on Stanford's Movie Review Corpus

## Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Stanford's movie review dataset. Various machine learning models, including Linear SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are trained and evaluated to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Getting Started

### 1. Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from Stanford's website at the following link:
[Stanford Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/amaas/data/sentiment/)

After downloading, unzip the files and place them in a directory named `data` within the project's root directory.

### 2. Installation
To set up the required environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Results
Based on the conducted experiments:

- **Linear SVM** proved to be the most effective with a test accuracy of **88.82%**.
- **Logistic Regression** closely followed with **87.37%**.
- Other models, such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, achieved test accuracies of **85.66%**, **84.49%**, and **80.75%** respectively.
